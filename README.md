# Performance Analysis of Internet of Things Interactions via Simulation-Based Queueing Models



## Abstract

A variety of middleware APIs and protocols exist to help in the development of Internet of Things (IoT) applications. These apps can rely on either reliable or less reliable protocols that offer different Quality of Service (QoS) levels. Using these protocols, APIs, and varying QoS levels can help meet the requirements of critical IoT applications, such as those used in emergency response situations. To study QoS in these IoT applications, we need to employ a method of performance analysis. This is where queueing network models come in - they provide a framework for analyzing and modeling IoT interactions in terms of QoS through either analytical or simulation models. In this paper, we present various queueing models that can represent different QoS scenarios in IoT interactions. Specifically, we propose queueing models that can illustrate factors such as message drop probabilities, inconsistent mobile connectivity, message availability or validity, prioritization of crucial information, and the processing or transmission of messages. Our simulation models demonstrate that altering QoS settings significantly impacts both the success rates of delivery and response times.
